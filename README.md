### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Github profile! If you are a recruiter or hiring manager interested in my coding ability and style, please contact me via email for a code sample (tim@bakertim.com). Most of my recent work is hosted on private Gitlab repositories, but I would happy to share. An older code sample can be found in [this repo](https://github.com/tim-the-baker/eHAIL-code-sample).

I'm currently developing computer vision pipelines using machine learning and deep learning. Recent applications include segmenting large medical images (100,000+ voxels) with U-Net architectures and registering these same medical images using the Elastix image registration toolkit. I enjoy working with large 3D image data and overcoming challenges with processing time, visualization, noisy labels, and class imbalance.

MONAI is an open-source deep learning library for medical image analysis built on top of PyTorch. I have used MONAI's Data and Transformation modules extensively in my work. I am excited to give back to this project by contributing new features and tutorials. For example, I am drafting a guide for overcoming the challenge of integrating MONAI, PyTorch Lightning, and Weights and Biases while deploying on a SLURM cluster with multi-GPU training. In other news, my first MONAI pull request was merged in February 2024 :)
