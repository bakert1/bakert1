### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Github profile! If you are a recruiter or hiring manager interested in my coding ability or style, please contact me via email for a code sample. Most of my recent work is hosted on private repositories, but I would happy to share if requested.

I'm currently developing computer vision pipelines using machine learning and deep learning. Recent applications include segmenting large medical images (100,000+ voxels) with U-Net architectures and registering these same medical images using the Elastix image registration toolkit. I enjoy working with large 3D image data and overcoming challenges with processing time, visualization, and class imbalance.

MONAI is an open-source deep learning library for medical image analysis built on top of PyTorch. I have used MONAI's Data and Transformation modules extensively in my work. I am excited to give back to this project by contributing new features and tutorials. For example, it was somewhat difficult to fully integrate MONAI, PyTorch Lightning, and Weights and Biases while also deploying on a SLURM cluster. I am drafting a guide for this process. I completed my first new feature in February 2024 :)
